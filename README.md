# Getting Started
## Hello Rails I
Ruby on Rails is a web framework that makes it easy to build powerful web apps in a short amount of time.

Ruby on Rails is written in the Ruby programming language. If you are new to Ruby, we recommend you do this course first.

    1. Let's get started by making a Rails app for a personal website. We'll explain each  step in the next exercise. In the terminal, type:
            rails new MySite
    
    2. Then run: 
            bundle install
    
    3. Finally type:
            rails server

    4. View the Rails app in the browser by visiting http://localhost:8000. Then click Next to find out what these commands do.
